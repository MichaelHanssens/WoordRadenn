What is it?
Guess the word is an open source, drop-in verification game that will allow your members to safely play the game on their smartphone. This empowers the user with the following advantages:
Speak with confidence, because everyone is who their name says they are.
Adding an extra step between trolls & spammers and your server will reduce unwanted activity drastically.
The verification database is already populated with thousands of Discord-Roblox account links, so it's possible users will already be verified when they join your server.
The hosted version of RoVer does not have any API rate limiting and will automatically be able to update roles the second the user verifies. (If you host RoVer yourself, the user will have to run a command in order for the verification to take place.)
How does it work?
